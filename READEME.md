learn how to culculate net salary and payee by adding NHIF Deductions,NSSF Deductions,gross salary and net salary

## Introduction 
Practice what you have learnt in the javascript
create a repository on your GitHub account 
use javascript to write down the solution

## instructions 
open vs code create an `index.js` folder 
at `index.js` write a code that culculates the grade of students
use `else if` statements to write down the code 
the grade will automatically prompted

In the `speed.js`we use function if else to culculate the speed of the vehicle 
Write a code that promts the motorist if the vehicle speed is `ok` or per every `5km `past the speed limit a total of `1 point `should be prompted
